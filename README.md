# Javascript Web Development 
## Final Project - Spartan Profiles App

### Introduction
Sparta Global is growing as a business very quickly, and as such has to be very adaptable to the needs of its clients. The management team has decided to commission a Spartan Profiles website to display its consultants without the need for a traditional CV. This way, a client can log on to the website and browse the consultants themselves given the appropriate information. It also feels more modern and professional. 

In two teams, your dev team must prototype the website for final presentation on Thursday 3rd November. You have been given a template based on Sparta Global's project build pipeline for MERN stack projects which already includes API authentication using JSON Web Tokens and BCrypt.js. It also has a test suite preconfigured.  

### Learning Objectives

 - Cement knowledge of the technologies listed below.

### Technologies to use

### User Stories - what it should be capable of
These are a guide given at the start of the project by the product owner, and are subject to emerging requirements as the project develops. These should form the basis of your Sprint Planning. All users are expected to have no development background.

 	- Log in and see an admin homepage
 	- View all Spartans on the site
	- Search through Spartans by name
 	- Update any Spartan profile with new information
 	- Set any Spartan to be either 'available' or 'on site'
 	- Delete any Spartan profile
 	- Create client user credentials so specific clients can browse the site

#### Spartan

### Timeframe
This project begins on Monday 24th October at 12.00pm and finished on Wednesday 2nd November at 9.00pm. The first day should be spent on the following tasks: 

 - familiarising the team with the technologies, pre-existing code and build pipeline
 - setting up Agile taskboards physically and digitally
 - defining a Definition of Done and establishing Acceptance Criteria
 - setting up any calendar invites and event for stakeholders
 - establishing any team roles the group deems appropriate.

After this first day, the project is split into two 4 day sprints. All appropriate Scrum methodologies should be used, particularly in terms of Sprint Planning (including assigning points to tasks) and Sprint Retrospectives.

### Presentation
On Thursday 3rd November your group will prepare and deliver a 15 minute slideshow presentation to a group of stakeholders. You should be prepared to deliver to trainers, other students, managers, sales professionals and clients. You should be prepared to answer questions  afterwards. It is important that the presentation covers the following criteria: 
 
 - It should be well planned and confidently presented
 - It should demonstrate and discuss the prototype you have created
 - It should discuss any big challenges faced by the group during the project, technical or group workflow related
 - It should state to what extent your group members satisfied the Learning Objectives
 - It should cover any personal triumphs or challenges overcome
